# File formats

On-disk data formats used by "Yendorian Tales Book I: Chapter 2"
(`SW.EXE`), cross-referenced against the disassembly as they're decoded.
**Nothing below is confirmed against the actual IDB/code yet** — this is
still a placeholder with the observational starting points from the
initial setup session (2026-09-14), now supplemented with two reference
documents Paul added the same day: `docs/manual.txt` (the official game
manual) and `docs/Hex Hacking Item Guide.txt` (a community-written 2004
guide by Josh Hines on hex-editing savegame items — freely
redistributable per its own footer). See [overview.md](overview.md) for
the full session notes and [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for priority order.

## `CURGAME` / `SAVGAME1` (and presumably `SAVGAMEn`)

77,509 bytes each, identical size. `SAVGAMEX` appears in `SW.EXE`'s
string table as a templated filename (`X` = slot digit), and the
in-EXE error string `"Problem with CURGAME."` / `"Problem with a SAVED
GAME file."` confirms `CURGAME` is the active/working copy distinct from
the numbered save slots.

First 32 bytes of `CURGAME` (hex-decoded):
```
53 4D 49 54 48 57 41 52 45 20 50 41 52 54 59 00   SMITHWARE PARTY\0
57 41 52 45 00 20 20 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   WARE\0   \0...
```
`"SMITHWARE PARTY\0WARE\0"` — identifies the developer as **SmithWare**
(matches `SW.EXE`'s name) and suggests a header/magic string rather than
game data proper.

### Item-slot encoding (from `Hex Hacking Item Guide.txt`, not yet cross-checked against the IDB)

Not independently verified against `SW.EXE`'s code yet, but internally
consistent and cross-confirmed against in-EXE strings (see below) enough
to treat as a strong starting hypothesis rather than a guess — a much
better starting point than `ultima1`'s `Savegame` struct work had, which
was derived from scratch.

Per-character section: appears roughly 15 text-rows below each
character's name in a hex view; a 4-character party gives 4 such
sections. Each character has **8 item slots** (matches the manual's
equip diagram: helmet, armor, gloves×2, rings×2, leggings, boots, plus
projectile/container/weapon/shield — the manual actually lists 10 named
body slots, so the "8 item slots" in the guide likely refers specifically
to the inventory-grid/backpack slots the guide's reset procedure empties,
not literally every equip slot; needs reconciling once the struct is
actually located).

Each item slot is **4 bytes**: `[item_id] [modifier] [uses] [unknown]`
- **Byte 0 (`item_id`)**: 0x00-0xFF, indexes a ~256-entry item table (see
  full table below).
- **Byte 1 (`modifier`)**: selects which "page" of the item table
  `item_id` is read against — `00` (weapons/armor/consumables page 1),
  `01` (armor/weapons page 2), `02` (armor/weapons/misc page 3) are all
  the guide documents; implies **at least ~768 distinct item
  definitions** across 3 pages, not just 256. Whether more pages exist
  past `02` isn't stated in the guide.
- **Byte 2 (`uses`)**: charge/use count for consumables (potions,
  scrolls, wands, rods) — `00` and `01` both mean 1 use, `02` = 2 uses,
  etc., up to `FF` (~255, described as "almost infinite"). **Does not
  apply to food** per the guide (tried and confirmed not to work).
- **Byte 3**: unknown/unconfirmed — guide author never observed a
  non-zero value and warns changing it may cause instability. Worth
  checking against the IDB once the struct is located (padding? a second
  modifier bit? unused?).

**Cross-confirmation against `SW.EXE`'s own strings** (from this
session's string survey in overview.md): the item table's door-key run
(`0x28`-`0x2E`: `Brass/Bronze/Copper/Iron/Steel/Silver/Gold door key`)
matches the exact 7-tier key hierarchy found in-binary
(`BRASS KEY`/`BRONZE KEY`/`COPPER KEY`/`IRON KEY`/`STEEL KEY`/
`SILVER KEY`/`GOLD KEY`), and the "Key of \<town\>" cluster
(`0x30`-`0x34`: Port Hope, Pariah, Numagik, Stony Peak, Tracking) lines
up with the town/password strings found in the binary (`PORT HOPE`,
`NUMAGIK`, `STONY PEAK`). This is good evidence the guide's table is
accurate for at least the shareware chapter's item set, not just
inferred/reconstructed after the fact by its author.

**Shareware relevance**: the guide notes the shareware version has a
blocked portal that can be bypassed by giving a character the "Key of
Pariah" (item `0x31`, modifier `00`) — directly explains the registration
nag string found this session (`"Thank You for playing... Please
register your copy today."`) and confirms `SW.EXE` (Share**w**are) is
content-limited by design, not just nagging.

**Full item ID table**: reproduced in full in
[`Hex Hacking Item Guide.txt`](Hex%20Hacking%20Item%20Guide.txt) — 3
pages of ~256 entries each (weapons, armor by material/enchant tier,
potions, scrolls/wands/rods/parchments of each skill, quest items, key
items, and a block of intentionally-broken "dummy"/crash items flagged
`*(3)` at the end of page 2). Not duplicated here; treat that file as the
source of truth and link back to it rather than copying the table, since
it's long and Paul may update it.

Next real step here: locate the actual per-character struct in the IDB
(candidate: the already-present but unidentified `Struc1`, per
roadmap.md) and verify slot byte offsets/count directly against this
guide rather than assuming it's exactly right.

## `WORLD.DAT`

1,761,397 bytes. Referenced by (unverified names, see overview.md)
`loadWorldDat1` through `loadWorldDat5` and `WorldDat_setBlock1` through
`WorldDat_setBlock6`. First 8 bytes read as repeating
`00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00` pairs in a quick raw peek — consistent with a
table of `(flag/type, count-or-offset)` pairs or similar, but this is a
guess from 64 bytes, not a traced format. Error strings suggest it holds
at least: text data, NPC data, conversation data (per `"Problem
retreiving text/NPC/conversation data."`), and presumably maps.

## `PICTURES.VGA`

**Decoded 2026-09-15.** 12,550,618 bytes, raw 8bpp indexed pixels (VGA
Mode 13h palette), no per-image header or compression — a directory
table elsewhere (`g_pictureDir`, in `SW.EXE`'s own data segment, not in
this file) says where each picture starts and how big it is; the file
itself is just a flat blob of pixel bytes back to back.

**Directory** (`g_pictureDir`, linear `0x3508E`, i.e. `DS:0x782E` with
`DS` fixed to paragraph `0x2D86` — see `fix_ds_segreg.py`): an array of
16-byte entries, indexed as `g_pictureDir + picture_id*0x10`:

```
+0x0  word   unused/reserved in the entries examined (always 0)
+0x2  word   unused/reserved in the entries examined (always 0)
+0x4  word   unconfirmed (varies per entry, not yet decoded)
+0x6  word   unused/reserved in the entries examined (always 0)
+0x8  word   width, pixels
+0xA  word   height, pixels
+0xC  word   file offset into PICTURES.VGA, low word
+0xE  word   file offset into PICTURES.VGA, high word
```

Verified directly by extracting and rendering three entries with
`ida_scripts/extract_pic.py` (grayscale, real VGA palette not recovered
yet — but shape alone was already unambiguous):

- **Entry 0** — 318×198 @ offset `0x0`: the **"SmithWare" splash-screen
  logo** (matches the developer name from `CURGAME`'s header string).
- **Entry 8** — 16×16 @ offset `0xBCF3DA`: a **mouse-cursor arrow**.
- **Entry 9** — 8×8 @ offset `0xBEF1DA`: a small **scroll-arrow icon**
  (matches `UpdateScrollArrows`' two-glyph indicator from earlier this
  session — likely one of its actual glyphs).
- **Entry 1** — 210×105 @ offset `0xE694C`: a UI panel with partial
  button-label text baked into the bitmap (`SAVE`/`LOAD`/`MUSIC`/`SOUND
  FX`/`DOS`/`RETURN` fragments legible) — the `GameDialog_draw*`
  background panel.

Loading path, fully traced in `ida_scripts/name_picture_system.py`:
`DrawPicture` (`0x29878`, called from `start` and 8+ other functions)
looks up `g_pictureDir[id]`, calls `LoadPictureIntoEms` (`0x2A68D`) to
ensure the picture's bytes are mapped into a small LRU cache of LIM EMS
4.0 pages (evicting the oldest entry on a cache miss and reading fresh
bytes from `PICTURES.VGA` — the fixed `FileEntry` at `bx=0x9011`, opened
once in `InitGame`), then blits `width`×`height` pixels from the EMS
page frame to the video buffer at `(x, y)`, with the blit mode selected
by `_font_bgTransparent` (0–5, different transparency/color-key
branches).

`sub_23874` (called repeatedly from `start`, presumably an intro
animation) indexes the same `g_pictureDir` table the same way
(`g_pictureDir + word_2E532`, `word_2E532` = `picture_id*0x10`) — it's
one shared directory, not a separate table per caller.

Not yet decoded: the real VGA palette (so images render in true color,
not grayscale), and the directory's `+0x4` field's meaning (varies per
entry, didn't fit an obvious role from the entries examined so far).

## Not yet examined

- `SBFMDRV.COM` — third-party(?) Sound Blaster FM driver, likely not
  worth reverse-engineering in detail (not game logic).
